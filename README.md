# Python-Challenge: 
In this Challenge, I learned how to use the fundamentals in Python.
The PyPoll project was about finding out the results of an election in a fictional town. In the PyPoll Project I calculated:

The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

  In the PyBank portion of the Project, I calculated the following:
  
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period 

I think what I learned the most was "how to learn" because of how many times I needed to review and truly come to understand what I was doing. I realized how much I loved studying on my own so that I can go at my own pace. I dedicated many many hours towards this project and I hope that you all enjoy it as much as I enjoyed completing it. I'm going to learn many other languages but I think this one might end up being my favorite. I received a lot of help from Mitchell Stone and Matt Bosworth (My Teachers). I also received help from Python.com and the Xpert Learning Assistant that the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp provides.
